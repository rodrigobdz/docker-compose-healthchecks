### Mongo

Note: `mongosh` may need to be used rather than `mongo`, depending on which image you're using.

```yml
healthcheck:
  test:
    [
      "CMD",
      "mongo",
      "--quiet",
      "127.0.0.1/test",
      "--eval",
      "'quit(db.runCommand({ ping: 1 }).ok ? 0 : 2)'",
    ]
  interval: 10s
  timeout: 10s
  retries: 5
  start_period: 40s
```

## Scripting

To wait for a Docker container until its health state is `healthy` before executing a command inside the container, use the following function in a shell script:

```sh
readonly DOCKER_CONTAINER='my_postgres'

wait_until_container_healthy() {
  until
    [ "$(docker inspect --format "{{.State.Health.Status}}" "$DOCKER_CONTAINER")" = 'healthy' ]
  do
    # Log container status
    local container_status
    container_status="$(docker inspect --format "{{.State.Health.Status}}" "$DOCKER_CONTAINER")"

    echo "Waiting for container $DOCKER_CONTAINER to be 'healthy', current status is '$container_status'. Sleeping for five seconds..."
    sleep 5
  done
}
```
